# In essanse the nanowave signature parser is a in depth mechine that can provide inverse reactive current, for use in unilateral phase detractors, but would also be capable
of automatically synchronizing cardinal grammeters. Such an instrument comprised of Dodge gears and bearings, Reliance Electric motors, Allen-Bradley controls, and all monitored
by our programed experienced and well tought robot team of mods. Now, basically the only new principle involved is that instead of power being generated by the relative motion
of conductors and fluxes, it’s produced by the modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance. The original machine had a base plate of prefabulated,
amulite, surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan. The lineup consisted simply of
six hydrocoptic marzelvanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that sidefumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus o-deltoid type
placed in panendermic semiboloid slots of the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe, to the differential girdlespring on the ‘up’ end
of the grammeters. Moreover, whenever fluorescence score motion is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocation dingle arm to reduce sinusoidal
depleneration.
